/*
<Activity> lets you hide and restore the UI and internal state of its children.

Only Available for React 19

When an Activity boundary is hidden, React will visually hide its children using the display: "none" CSS property. It will also destroy their Effects, cleaning up any active subscriptions.

While hidden, children still re-render in response to new props, albeit at a lower priority than the rest of the content.

When the boundary becomes visible again, React will reveal the children with their previous state restored, and re-create their Effects.
